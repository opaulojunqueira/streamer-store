# streamer-store
A store dedicated to your Twitch streaming

---
Project developed in parts: `API`, `Extension` and `Dashboard (Website)`:
- `API`: (where the magic happensâœ¨) The main server where you store the information of the created accounts, points for each user, items added to the store...
- `Extension`: Here users earn points by watching the live. The extension identifies the chests of points dropped in your live and automatically redeems them, thus sending a request to the API and there, several verifications of the received package are carried out, if valid, a number of points will be added to the user's database (amount of points is the streamer that defines in the panel).
- `Dashboard (Website)`: Oooh Dashboard... Where everything turns into a visual and end-user friendly interface. This part is a set formed by a main site and the dashboard itself. The site you know more about the project along with the buttons: create an account, login and support. Then the part of the Dashboard, is the information of points of the users farmed in the watched live and the store of the streamer. (both **Extension** and **Dashboard** are connected with **API**)
